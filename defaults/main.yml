# Role default lower priority variables

# List of dicts with files to configure. The dicts have the same attributes that
# the ones expected by the ansible file module, plus the `content` attribute to
# specify the content of the file (optional)
#
# For example:
#
# files:
#   - path: /mnt/tmp
#     user: root
#     group: root
#     mode: "0755"
#     content: Hello World
#

files: []

# Prefix to apply to all file paths

#files_prefix:

# Dicitionary with the defaults options to use if no other ones are specified in
# the `files` variable. The members of the dict are the same attributes
# that the ones expected by the ansible file module

files_defaults: {}

# Indicate `files` must be loaded also from host variables. Any host variable
# that begins with "files_*" and contains the necessary attributes
# will be loaded as an item to manage by the role. The variables must follow the
# structure detailed before for `files`

files_load_from_hostvars: no
